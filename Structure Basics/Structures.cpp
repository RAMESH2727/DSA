	Self Referential Structures -
	Have one or more pointers which point to the
	same type of structure, as their member.

	Types of Self Referential Structures:

	1. Self Referential Structure with Single Link - eg. Singly
	2. Self Referential Structure with Multiple Links - eg, Doubly

	Applications of Referential Structures -
	Creation of complex data structures like Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.
